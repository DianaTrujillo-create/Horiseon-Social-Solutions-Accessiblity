HORISEON SOCIAL SOLUTIONS ACCESIBILITY PAGE

This website was intended to be easily accessible for everyone. 
The navigation bar is now working properly; I also added semantic code in my HTML as well as CSS. 
Every image now contains an ALT attribute; just in case the image doesn't populate accurately. 
I had a couple of challenges with the aside semantic code; I was able to get the code to work, but could not figure out the spacing in the aside box. 
I did intend to use mostly semantic code and I believe I was able to reach that goal.
